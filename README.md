What does it do?

-Add a Task: You can tell it, "buy milk", then it will put the task into the list.
-Remove a Task: If you decide you don't need to buy milk after all, you can tell it to remove that task.
-Mark a Task as Done: When you finish a task (like "do homework"), you can mark it as completed.
-List All Tasks: It can show you everything you need to do and which ones are already done.

Why is it useful?

-It keeps track of your tasks in a neat list.
-It saves everything in a database so your tasks won't disappear when you turn off your computer.
-It's simple to use and run right from your command line, so you don't need a fancy program with a big window.
